- **Time & Date**: Saturday or Sunday from 10am‚Äì1pm.  

### Contact Information
- **EdVPs**: Patrick Mendoza (patmendoza6745@berkeley.edu), Anika Sikka (anikasikka@berkeley.edu)  
- **Mentored PMs**: Sarika Pasumarthy (sarikapasumarthy@berkeley.edu), Eduardo Lopez (eduardo_lopez@berkeley.edu)  

### Prerequisites
- Taken or concurrently enrolled in **CS 61A / Data 8** OR have previous coding experience  
- No prior industry experience  
- Little to no prior web dev experience  
- Completed **1 or fewer upper-division CS/Data Science technical courses** at UC Berkeley  

### Desired Course Outcomes
By the end of the 12 weeks, we hope you:  
- Are comfortable programming in **Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and SQL**  
- Know common data structures (Arrays, LinkedLists, Trees, HashTables)  
- Are familiar with frameworks such as **React, Node.js, NPM, PyTorch, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn**  
- Have a basic understanding of **Databases**  
- Understand fundamental ML/AI concepts (optimization, neural networks)  
- Feel comfortable working in a **team environment**, similar to industry  

### Course Content
The course will roughly follow this outline (subject to change based on member needs, popularity, and resources):  
1. Programming in Python  
2. Data Structures  
3. SQL and Databases  
4. Introduction to SWE  
5. Math for ML  
6. Classical ML  
7. Deep Learning  
8. Introduction to MLE  

### Course Outline
- **Weeks 1‚Äì4**: Welcome! & Intro to Programming in Python, Data Structures, Web Development, and Introduction to SWE  
- **Weeks 5‚Äì8**: Databases, and Math for ML  
- **Weeks 9‚Äì12**: Classical ML, Deep Learning, and Introduction to MLE  

### Homeworks
Throughout the course, we‚Äôll be releasing homeworks that accompany lectures.  
- **Deadline policy**: Homework must be submitted **before the next lecture** (no rolling extensions).  
- **Homework parties**: Weekly, right after lecture ‚Äî a space to ask questions and work together with your fellow members.  

‚ö†Ô∏è Failure to adhere to the above policies may impact your eligibility to become a **client developer** the following semester and to attend **Codebase social events**.  

### Midterm
Before switching to the ML portion of the curriculum, you‚Äôll take a **60-minute midterm**.  
- Mirrors lecture examples & homework problems  
- Not designed to trick you ‚Äî just to help us see how to best support the class  
- Scores will not be scrutinized heavily  
- üéâ Expect some festivities after the exam!  

### Final Project
You‚Äôll complete a **final course project** in teams of **3‚Äì4 people** (with 1‚Äì2 client devs and 1‚Äì2 mentored devs).  
- **Showcase**: At Codebase‚Äôs banquet, where you‚Äôll present everything you‚Äôve learned ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê  
- **Requirements**: Must incorporate full stack, databases, SWE practices, and machine learning  
- **Logistics**: Details announced in **Week 10**  

üëâ Think of an issue that matters to you ‚Äî in your life, your community, or the world ‚Äî and build a **tech-powered solution**!
