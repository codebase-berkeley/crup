Hi! I'm Jessica, one of the EdVPs for Codebase. I'm passionate about making tech education accessible and building inclusive communities. I love working on machine learning projects and helping students grow their technical skills. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new coffee shops or hiking in the Bay Area!
