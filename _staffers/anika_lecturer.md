Hi! I'm Anika, one of the instructors for CRUP. I'll be teaching the Python programming fundamentals and helping you build a strong foundation in software engineering. I love seeing students grow their confidence with coding and problem-solving. When I'm not teaching, I'm usually working on open-source projects or exploring new programming languages.
