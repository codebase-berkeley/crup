Hello! I'm Sarah, a teaching assistant for CRUP. I'm here to help you with any questions about the material, debugging your code, or just general programming concepts. I specialize in web development and machine learning, so feel free to ask me anything about React, Python, or ML frameworks. I'm excited to help you on your coding journey!
