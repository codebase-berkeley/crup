Hey everyone! I'm Patrick, the other EdVP for Codebase. I'm excited to help you ramp up your software engineering and machine learning skills! I specialize in full-stack development and have worked on projects ranging from web applications to ML pipelines. I believe in learning by doing, so get ready for some hands-on projects. Outside of tech, I enjoy playing guitar and exploring the Berkeley food scene.
